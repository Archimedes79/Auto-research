| experiment id | E130 |
| theme | T9 - Fully differentiable builder ladder, successive halving D1-D8 (loop 16, 16b) (loop 16) |
| tag | E - E2E-usable: learned or parameter-free, differentiable (the trace network has discrete bookkeeping inside) |
| sparsification stage | SP1 seeds and key points (peak picking, node heat maps); SP4 keep and verify (precision gates, verifiers, probabilities); SP5 learned sparse extractor (step choice, vertices, events) |
| building blocks | BB01 convolution, U-Net / FPN pyramids; BB03 grid sampling, spatial transformer, warping; BB13 relation bias, graph transformer, message passing; BB14 pointer attention; BB22 survival / transmittance verification along a ray; BB23 teardrop (distance-dependent polar) sampling pattern; BB26 tree -> DAG merge and edge split (geometric); BB29 matching-free point-to-polyline loss; BB30 labels computed from geometry |

## Result

S 0.701, F1@1 0.819, F1@0.5 0.650, J 0.149, 12.4 vertices per 100 m, false length 0.031, tau 0.5; VAL subset of 250 frames, 1 u; with beam 192 and 96 seeds S 0.720

## Techniques used (register K ids)

- K01: teardrop pattern: short rays in all directions, long narrow forward rays, samples on shared rings  (internal)
- K02: verification along a ray, survival / discrete-time hazard (same algebra as volume-rendering transmittance)  (NeRF from memory)
- K03: n best endpoints as hypotheses; next N vertices with validity in a local window  (checked)
- K04: deformable sampling at predicted offsets, reference points refined per layer  (checked)
- K10: lane segments + topology head  (checked)
- K12: path-level supervision instead of pieces  (checked)
- K13: vertex and edge maps, GNN adjacency; local candidate edges  (checked / internal)
- K15: matching-free point-to-polyline refinement of a traced graph  (internal)
- K21: soft non-maximum suppression  (from memory)
- K23: scheduled sampling, DAgger (own states replace expert states)  (from memory)
